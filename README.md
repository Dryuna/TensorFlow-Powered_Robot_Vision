# TensorFlow-Powered Vision For Pi-based robot

***

* [Written by Korean version](https://github.com/leehaesung/TensorFlow-Powered_Robot_Vision/blob/master/README_Korean.md)

## Introduction

This is a Pi-based robot to implement visual recognition([by Inception V3](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/03/train-your-own-image-classifier-with.html)). The TensorFlow-Powered vision can recognize many objects such as people, car, bus, fruits, and so on. 

* Hardware: Raspberry-Pi2, Sony PS3 Eye Camera
 
   (Available to use Logitech C270 USB camera with Raspberry Pi)

* Software: TensorFlow(v1.0.1), Jupyter-Notebook

## My motivation
 I was so curious about excellence of the image recognition with TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi. Also, the Jupyter notebook is very convenient to instantly code as a quick prototype. So, in terms of error rate of the image classification, Inception V3(3.46%) is more excellent than human(5.1%) whereas raspberry pi's processing speed is very slow compare to my laptop.
