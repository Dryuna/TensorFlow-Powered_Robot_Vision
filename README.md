# TensorFlow-Powered Vision For Pi-based robot

***

## Introduction

This is a Pi-based robot to implement visual recognition. The TensorFlow-Powered vision(Inception V3) can recognize many objects such as people, car, fruits, and so on. 

* Hardware: Raspberry-Pi2, PS3 Eye Camera

* Software: TensorFlow(v1.0.1), Jupyter-Notebook
